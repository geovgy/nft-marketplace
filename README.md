# On-Chain NFT Marketplace

An entirely on-chain NFT marketplace for trading ERC721 and ERC1155 standard tokens. The smart contract takes concepts from orderbook-styled exchanges for structuring offers for each token.

## Key Features

1. All listings are completely on-chain.

2. NFT owners can list their NFT for sale and still keep it in their own wallet until the trade has been completed.

3. Royalties are instantly distributed during same transaction as trade for any NFT contracts that follows the ERC2981 standard (not fully implemented yet).

## Current Status

It is unfinished and untested at the moment.
